    "# Building your Recurrent Neural Network - Step by Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Course 5's first assignment! In this assignment, you will implement your first Recurrent Neural Network in numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have \"memory\". They can read inputs $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ (such as words) one at a time, and remember some information/context through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time-step to the next. This allows a uni-directional RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidirection RNN can take context from both the past and the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notation**:\n",
    "- Superscript $[l]$ denotes an object associated with the $l^{th}$ layer. \n",
    "    - Example: $a^{[4]}$ is the $4^{th}$ layer activation. $W^{[5]}$ and $b^{[5]}$ are the $5^{th}$ layer parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Superscript $(i)$ denotes an object associated with the $i^{th}$ example. \n",
    "    - Example: $x^{(i)}$ is the $i^{th}$ training example input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Superscript $\\langle t \\rangle$ denotes an object at the $t^{th}$ time-step. \n",
    "    - Example: $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ is the input x at the $t^{th}$ time-step. $x^{(i)\\langle t \\rangle}$ is the input at the $t^{th}$ timestep of example $i$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Lowerscript $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of a vector.\n",
    "    - Example: $a^{[l]}_i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of the activations in layer $l$.\n",

    "Congratulations! You've successfully built the forward propagation of a recurrent neural network from scratch. This will work well enough for some applications, but it suffers from vanishing gradient problems. So it works best when each output $y^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ can be estimated using mainly \"local\" context (meaning information from inputs $x^{\\langle t' \\rangle}$ where $t'$ is not too far from $t$). \n",

    "This following figure shows the operations of an LSTM-cell.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/LSTM.png\" style=\"width:500;height:400px;\">\n",
    "<caption><center> **Figure 4**: LSTM-cell. This tracks and updates a \"cell state\" or memory variable $c^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ at every time-step, which can be different from $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$. </center></caption>\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the RNN example above, you will start by implementing the LSTM cell for a single time-step. Then you can iteratively call it from inside a for-loop to have it process an input with $T_x$ time-steps. \n",

    "### About the gates\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Forget gate\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this illustration, lets assume we are reading words in a piece of text, and want use an LSTM to keep track of grammatical structures, such as whether the subject is singular or plural. If the subject changes from a singular word to a plural word, we need to find a way to get rid of our previously stored memory value of the singular/plural state. In an LSTM, the forget gate lets us do this: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\sigma(W_f[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}] + b_f)\\tag{1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $W_f$ are weights that govern the forget gate's behavior. We concatenate $[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}]$ and multiply by $W_f$. The equation above results in a vector $\\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ with values between 0 and 1. This forget gate vector will be multiplied element-wise by the previous cell state $c^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$. So if one of the values of $\\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ is 0 (or close to 0) then it means that the LSTM should remove that piece of information (e.g. the singular subject) in the corresponding component of $c^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$. If one of the values is 1, then it will keep the information. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Update gate\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we forget that the subject being discussed is singular, we need to find a way to update it to reflect that the new subject is now plural. Here is the formulat for the update gate: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Gamma_u^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\sigma(W_u[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\{t\\}}] + b_u)\\tag{2} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the forget gate, here $\\Gamma_u^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ is again a vector of values between 0 and 1. This will be multiplied element-wise with $\\tilde{c}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$, in order to compute $c^{\\langle t \\rangle}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Updating the cell \n",
    "\n",
    "To update the new subject we need to create a new vector of numbers that we can add to our previous cell state. The equation we use is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{c}^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\tanh(W_c[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}] + b_c)\\tag{3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the new cell state is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ c^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}* c^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle} + \\Gamma_u^{\\langle t \\rangle} *\\tilde{c}^{\\langle t \\rangle} \\tag{4} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Output gate\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide which outputs we will use, we will use the following two formulas: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Gamma_o^{\\langle t \\rangle}=  \\sigma(W_o[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}] + b_o)\\tag{5}$$ \n",
    "$$ a^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\Gamma_o^{\\langle t \\rangle}* \\tanh(c^{\\langle t \\rangle})\\tag{6} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where in equation 5 you decide what to output using a sigmoid function and in equation 6 you multiply that by the $\\tanh$ of the previous state. "
